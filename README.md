# Welcome

Welcome to the open**solar** wiki. This wiki contains information related to openx, opensolar, and the open finance framework. The project has been incubated at the [MIT Digital Currency Initiative](www.dci.mit.edu/opensolar) and the [Yale Open Innovation Lab](www.openlab.yale.edu/open-solar) over the last two years and is now hosted at the [Open Earth Foundation](www.openearth.foundation).

If you would like to contribute to the source code or take up a project, please checkout open issues on GitHub or reach out to us and we can suggest projects that would be a good fit.
