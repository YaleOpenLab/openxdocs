# Welcome

Welcome to the open**solar** wiki. This wiki contains information related to openx, opensolar, and the open finance framework. 

The [OpenSolar](www.demo.openx.solar) project was launched as a jointed research initiative between the Digital Currency Initiative of the [MIT Media Lab](www.dci.mit.edu) and the [Yale Open Innovation Lab](www.openlab.yale.edu). OpenSolar inspired the idea for a broader open finance framework to drive automation in climate and SDG financing, an ambition now spearheaded by the [Open Earth Foundation](www.openearth.foundation). 

If you would like to contribute to the source code or take up a project, please checkout open issues on GitHub or reach out to us and we can suggest projects that would be a good fit.
